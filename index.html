	I am a theorist working on cold atom and condensed matter physics, with an interest in unconventional phases of matters. My research chiefly spans two broad areas. One is the non-equilibrium phases of matter, where cold atom experiments provides extraordinary tunability while conventional many-body theories are in severe deficit regarding treating far-from-equilibrium systems. The other is quantum spin liquids, where one could witness the beautiful marriage between gauge theories and concepts in solid state systems.

	After obtaining my PhD at the Ohio State University (2010-2016) under the supervision of Prof. Tin-Lun Ho, I went to University of Pittsburgh (2016-2019) as a postdoc in Prof. W. Vincent Liu's group. Currently, I have moved to Max-Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems (2019-present) at Dresden, Germany, as a Guest Scientist.
